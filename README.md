## Overview

Contains code from following various tutorials for creating different kinds of machine learning models with Keras. Only original project I messed around with here is contained in `rule-learning-attempt-1.ipynb`. As a toy experiment, I wanted to see if I could get a simple neural net to implement a function which just adds 1 to the input. And if it worked, I wanted to see how it would accomplish it. I had been reading about curriculum learning and wondered if I could teach a neural net basic arithmetic, and then see if I could get better/different results by training it in a very structured way, since add1 is sort of like a 'prerequisite operation' to addition, just like addition is kind of a prerequisite operation for multiplication. And it feels to me like the way we learn is by first learning about these simpler component concepts and then combining them into more complicated ones.

I was surprised to learn how much fiddling/tuning it took to get just add1 to perform well. I never got to the curriculum learning hypothesis, but if I ever come back to this idea I'm probably gonna have to use something other than Keras since as far as I can tell it doesn't give quite the level of control over network architecture I think I would want.
